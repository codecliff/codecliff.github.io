<h3 class="q">Q: What‚Äôs the ‚ÄúEdge Blur‚Äù slider for?</h3>

<h2 id="faq_developer">Curious Human FAQ: </h2>

<h3 class="q">Q: What's under the hood?</h3>
<p>A: Mediapipe, Opencv , Pyside2 , Qt5.5 , and recently a good dose of help from Gemini, openAI and Perplexity</p>

<h3 class="q">Q: Why such an old version of Mediapipe?</h3>
<p>A: To keep the file size in check. </p>

<h3 class="q">Q: Why are there so few comments in the code?</h3>

<p>A: Because I have also cobbled together a decent comment remover for Python. It's here - 
  <a href="https://github.com/codecliff/NoCommentsPython" target="_blank" > NoCommentsPython </a> &#128520; 
  <br/> Actually , the current code is quite a mess. All this started as a mere script.
   I plan to put all the comments back in after I have made the code modular proper. 
</p>

<h2>The Epilogue</h2>

<p>
PhotoGlimmer is a photo editor with one objective-  To make it easy for photography enthusiasts 
 like me to highlight people in the foreground without requiring astronomical level of image editing skills; 
 at the same time it should also give you the ability and satisfaction of manual editing. 
Standing in a mountain's shadow or enjoying a setting sun,  we deserve to look just as good as the scenery behind
 us. 
 </p>
 <p>
 Here's a shot at doing that withougt using an advanced operation on a complex image editor.
  And having a lot more manual control than a phone app.

</p>
<p>
I hope you will find it as useful as I have, and have as much fun using it.  
</p>
<p>
So go ahead. Brighten faces, blur backgrounds, and if things go wrong, there‚Äôs always the ‚èÆ button to start again. 
</p>
<p>
psst! Somethimes, lowering the brightness and color values also works very well.  
</p>
